Slimbox 2 requires the jQuery library (version 1.2.6 or more recent) to be installed on your website in order to work properly.
Slimbox SE requires the swfobject library (version 2.2 or more recent) to be installed on your website in order to work properly.

You can remove or customize the provided autoload code block by editing the autoload.js file. By default, it behaves like Lightbox.

When deploying slimboxSE.js, you MUST always preserve the copyright notice at the beginning of the file.

If you are a developer and want to edit the provided source code, it is strongly recommended to minify the script using "YUI Compressor"
by Julien Lecomte before distribution. It will strip spaces and comments and shrink the variable names in order to obtain the smallest file size.

Have fun!
